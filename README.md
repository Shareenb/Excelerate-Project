**Excelerate Platform Data Analysis Dashboard**

**Project Overview**


This project was developed as part of my role as a Data Visualization Associate Intern at Excelerate. The goal was to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the platform's user engagement, global reach, and opportunity popularity. The dashboard was built using Google Looker Studio and leverages data preprocessing techniques to ensure accuracy and clarity in the visualizations.
